## My process

### Built with:

- Mobile First Workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- JavaScript


### What I learned

This is the second project I did with the use of JavaScript also the first one I attempted with the "mobile first" approach. I learned and tried to implement a lot new functions, elements and selectors in order to make the page resemble the design as much as possible.
I also implemented a small animation as a test and it turned out decently.

I am not satisfied with the amount of time it took me to position all elements effectively with CSS.


### Continued development

Since I had difficulty positioning elements effectively I intend to practise CSS more. Also I think that JS I used is too complex and that refactoring it to be more readable might be possible.
